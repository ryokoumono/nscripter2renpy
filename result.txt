` Name of the game: Bloody Royale 3, or BR3 for short!@ The third installment in the transforming, fighting game series.\

` And my student goes airborne.@

` Much like playing a six beat song on a guitar.@

` Even though she's using a handicap, I can't do anything.@

` And without even an attack I am defeated.\

` Even as she speaks her controller moves at the speed of sound.@
` And again my student hits the ground flat on his face|@ Doesn't this game even have falling techniques?\

`"Ah, falling techniques are useless in this game, it seems.@ Once you go airborne, you have to prepare yourself for some hits.@ But you can transform once to get out of it."@

` With a push, the screen becomes bright as the student transforms.@
` I thought maybe it would transform into something like a uniformed mole, but it only changed from school uniform to PE uniform.\

`"Wow| how tasteless|"@

` I don't know when she changed characters, but there it is: a changed female character.@
`"Ah, her moves are clean.@ The scrounching movement looks cute like Hisui!"@

` What can you decide with an athletic festival|\

`"Eh| anyway, let's give up on fighting games.@ Let's play something I have a better chance of winning at."@
`"Ah? Then how about a racing game?"@
` She whips out a game with three Latin letters as its title.\

`"Tsk| one service per day|@ Fine, I'll yield to you today."@
` Arihiko stuffs many eggs into his mouth.@ Doesn't his stomach explode from so many eggs?\

`"But to turn the topic around, why are you eating out today?@ Did you do something terrible so you can't stay in the mansion?"@
`"Mmm| if I do something like that my life would already be over|@ No, there really is no reason.@ I just wanted to have a meal with you.@
` But what about you?@ Ichigo-san's back, isn't she?@ Is it okay to be out during dinnertime?"@
`"Ah, a little|@ there's something complicated in my house|@ If I'm alone I think I'll go mad.@ I'm so glad you called."@
` Arihiko's talk just now doesn't sound definite.\

`"Heeeh?@ You can't stand a woman?@ I thought your motto was that women are lovable no matter what they do."@
`"Idiot| that's only when I've fallen for her.@ But, I do like most women."\

`"Hmmm|@ Then the one bothering you right now doesn't suit your taste?"@
`"That's|@ it's really weird and complicated.@ I don't really want to even recognize it.@ Tohno, do you believe in spirits and ghosts?"@
` Uuuh| such a question is difficult to answer|@
` If I, who already has a foot in that other world, answer truthfully, it'll sound like a lie, and if I lie, it'll sound sincere|\

`"Right|@ I don't think mysteries are all bad.@ For example, it's another word for romance and the unexplained."@
`"Romance?!@ You're really something.@ You call that idiotic horse romance!"@

`"But, maybe it's a luxurious worry.@ It's nothing like yours, so it's a relief."@
`"Nothing like mine?@ What do you mean by that, Mr. Arihiko?"@
`"Hehehehe| anyway, let me have a grilled pork sheet."@

`"Arihiko, I need to ask you something weird|"@
` When I ordered my second bowl and Arihiko his third, I suddenly feel like asking that question.@
`"If I say that yesterday's dream feels like today, can you believe it?"@
`"--------"@
` He contemplates.@ One of his positive qualities is that he can tell a joke from an important matter and turn serious at a second's notice.\

`"I can't answer either way, as I'm not you.@ Well| if you're talking about deja vus, I get those from time to time."@
`"Yeah, I thought it was that at first, too, but I think it's different from a deja vu.@ If you actually encounter the situation, you usually realize it's a dream, don't you?"@
`"Right, that's correct.@ It's instinct."\

`"But the thing that's weird about my case is that what's happening today becomes yesterday's dream|"@
`"?@ That's paradoxical|"@
`"I know, that's why I'm confused.@ And in addition, I only think that during the night.@ When I wake up in the morning, it's all happy and good, and I forget yesterday's dream."@
`"Heeh| you're dreaming something weird again|@ I personally dream only old dreams nowadays."@
` Slurp.@ Arihiko drinks the soup.\

`"Old dreams|?"@
`"Yeah.@ I don't really want to think about it, but I can't help it.@ Like when we were young we used to fight a lot and go on top of people's roofs and talk about boring stuff.@
` Such traumatic events."@
`"Traumatic?@ They're nightmares?"@
` | Nightmare.@ I didn't even think about it, but some of my dreams of yesterday probably contain what people call nightmares.\

`"Mmm| like trauma or fear of death|@ I thought I was more resistant to these things than people around my age.@
` And then I became classmates with a certain someone even more messed up than me, and we fought often.@ Then I found out that I didn't really accept the fact that human lives can end suddenly as well as I had thought I did.@ Rather, I was doing my best to deny the truth.@
` Well| those are the things that come up in my dream.@ They're pathetic memories, so I don't want to reminisce about them, but I suppose they could have their value."\

`"Yeah|@ this isn't related, either, but about that classmate|@ I'm sure he's thinking the same thing as you."@
`"Heheh.@ That's good.@ He has a bright future.@ If I treat him well now, I'll be sure to reap the rewards later."@
` Arihiko smiles.\

`------------Ah| I really have been treated well.@
` If I didn't have Arihiko, then I probably would have spent my teenage years in loneliness|@
` Trying hard to isolate myself from others as if I've reached enlightenment.@
` I was about to spend the only time in my life when I would be allowed to smile freely with such childish thoughts.\

`"Then, let me ask something, too.@ Tohno, did your answer to the question I asked earlier change?"@
`"--------"@
` His eyes are the same, but his words are extremely kind.@
` When was I asked a question with such a kind voice|@
` It was in elementary school, the last day of our hating each other.\

`"Mmm, it probably won't change.@ How about you?"@
`"Ah, it's the same here."@
`"What, we haven't made progress, neither of us."@
`"Haa| it's been such a stubborn relationship.@ I guess the only way to cut it now would be to die."@
`"What?@ If we really die, then we never can cut it."@
`"------------"@
` Arihiko opens his mouth widely, then|@
`"That is so|@ That part about you is scary."@
` Laughs a laugh from the bottom of his heart.\

`"Hmm?@ Okay, then where should I start|"@
` Arcueid looks happy.@ Even though the content might be a little off, she's always happy to talk.@
`"Firstly, what is a familiar?@ Answering that question first would be appreciated."\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t01a.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst
`"Okay, then I'll start with the types of familiars.@
` A familiar is a magus' helper.@ But it's essentially different from a maid or a slave.@ A familiar is a part of a magus, and it's also something that represents the magus."@
`"A part?@ Right, Nrvnqsr's familiars were Nrvnqsr himself, but are all other magi like that too?@ Do they carry them in their bodies?"\

ld c,":a;image\tachi\ark_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_fst

`"Nrvnqsr was special.@ A familiar shares a mental and physical connection with the master, but regular masters can't form an equal connection with every one of them like Nrvnqsr.@
` Mmm|@ In other words, magi don't come out.@ Their first priority is taking their sorcery into the realm of magic, and they don't have time for other things.@
` But when something urgently requires their attention, then they send their familiars as ambassadors.@ They don't have specified roles like spying or patrolling or assassinating, but they adapt their roles using an algorithm to faithfully mimic what its owner would do.@ First-rate familiars are those who can act on their own without the master's will."\


`"Sorry, but I don't really understand.@ Tell me something simpler.@ Like, for example, your familiar is a black cat.@ But was it originally a black cat?"@
`"Len?@ Len's a combination of a human spirit and the corpse of a cat.@ Right, then I should explain that to you first, Shiki."\


`"Listen carefully.@ Familiars are life forms not within the normal 'system.'@
` Magi need a part of themselves.@ But that part doesn't need the 'part' to think and act exactly like them.@ What they need is something that has about the same level of rationale and reasoning, but can think independently.@ That way they can act as a teacher, and have the familiar be a teacher to them, too.@
` It's better to discover new things that way, and it also makes it easier for them to realize their own mistakes."\


`"All that's fine, but it's very difficult to make a human and maintain it.@
` So they usually use small animals for this 'part.'@ They prepare a container for the 'reason,' and that container usually is a cat or a dog."\


`"And so, they prepare the corpse of a small animal and a human's lingering mind.@
` Someone else's lingering mind|@ It's easier if you use the mind of a dead person the world still remembers.@ Since the mind has just left the body, it's easier to put the personality in a new container.@
` Now the master needs to repair the small animal's corpse so that it can move, and adds on to it so that it can become a part of him."\


`"Usually it's blood, hair, an eye, or other parts of the body that contain strong magic circuits that get put into the animal.@
` With that the connection is established between the master and the familiar, and the familiar now possess a magic circuit it didn't have before.@
` And the revived animal is no longer an animal at this point, but an individual life limited to the magus' lifespan."\


`"Ah, but the thing to keep in mind is that that's not reviving a dead person.@ It's strictly using the parts left behind to combine other parts, so it doesn't transcend into the realm of magic.@
` And the familiar starts acting for the master in the busy outside world, and before long, it'll become the symbol of the magus."\


`"Well, there are some that are definitely against it, and in those cases, they might use already living things as familiars.@ Although they become magical monsters that resemble us more."\


`"||||||"@
` In other words, that child is a black cat, and also a girl.@ One can't tell which one comes first.@
`"Using the parts of someone who passed away|@ But it's not considered reviving the dead.@ Just merely putting another life in."\


`"It's more exactly 'giving' than 'putting in.'@
` Familiars can work off of common nutrition, but it'll soon become infeasible.@ Since they are grafted with magic circuits, they can certainly use sorcery, but they lack the ability to regenerate mana.@
` For example, it's like a light bulb.@ You can't turn it on without electricity.@ And that electricity flows out of the magus.@ If the familiar doesn't get supplied by the master, it cannot perform magic and will soon die."\


`"So, a familiar without a master|"@
`"Is dead.@ It's essentially a life form maintained by the master.@ It dying is only natural."@
` The power of nature, says Arcueid.\


`"It's different from a cat without an owner.@ A familiar without an owner doesn't exist.@ Ah, but one like Len, who has a little bit of demonic nature, can make another contract to live on.@
` Len's active life is short, but she was made a long time ago.@ So she's growing as a familiar, and also as an animal spirit.@ In addition, the magus who created Len was extraordinary, so Len has much latent potential."\


`"---------------"@
` I let out a sigh of relief after that comment.@
` I don't know her situation, but since she's Arcueid's familiar, she's already found a new owner.\

`"Mmm| in essence, familiars are not very common.@ Well, usually, they're the hands and feet of a magus.@

` And this is what we call a familiar."\

`"Well, basically.@ But a familiar is also a symbol of the magus.@ It's on a different level than other one-time use trash.@ Some magi even take out insurance by passing everything on to their familiars.@ Well, to explain it simply, it's a spare self that is a little behind on abilities."@
`"The, then| Arcueid's familiar is almost as great as Arcueid?"\


`"Mmm| the relationship between Arcueid and that dream demon is different.@ It was created by someone else, and Arcueid is only taking care of it for now.@
` In other words, that dream demon has a great magic circuit, and so, if it were to make a contract with a weak magus, it could actually eat up the magus.@ So until a suitable person appears, Arcueid's just acting as its guardian."\


`"Then, that familiar was someone else's cat and is now alone?"@
`"Yes.@ The former owner has probably already passed away.@
` A magus gives his familiar his own magic circuit|@ something magical like eyes, hair, blood or skin, so that the familiar gets a magic circuit it didn't have before, and that makes it a part of the magus.@
` In this case, the small animal would be Arcueid's dream demon.@ That cat can now perform sorcery like a magus, but it cannot regenerate mana."\


`"Since familiars are actually corpses that are now moving again, it's sort of a sorcery, too.@ So it needs to get a continuous supply of mana from the master to function and perform sorcery.@ Since the familiar cannot regenerate its own mana, it will soon die if its master is gone."\

` The most pressing matter after hearing Senpai's explanation is the relationship between Arcueid and the familiar.@
` Arcueid said that she's not the master of the familiar.@

`"What|@ then that child won't die or anything like that?"@
`"No, Arcueid's dream demon won't be able to last much longer this way.@
` Because Arcueid doesn't require a familiar, she won't order it to steal other people's life force, and without the order, the familiar won't go out on its own to do so.@ And Arcueid can't make a contract with something that has arrived at the territory of demons.@

` We're to use tackles only, but even that can't be safe.@ With each challenger, a student from our class is sent to the infirmary.\

br
` The magus ended his days within her understanding, ever so alone.@
` There is no reason why she would know what research he was doing.@
` A magus pursues magic, even though he knows that neither he nor his next incarnation can ever reach the goal.@
` But no matter how many enlightenments one goes through, there is no magus who reached the level of magic.@
` A magus can never reach magic, and he is never rewarded.\


br
br
br
br
` The first thing that a magus learns seems to be that no matter what he does, he needs to know that he will never ever be rewarded.@
` But she heard from her second owner that they pass on their knowledge accumulated over many generations to their successors.\


br
br
br
` But, then what was this magus?@
br
` He didn't have students, nor did he chase after magic.@
` Nor was he interested in fame.@
br
` For a long time, he has never been satisfied.\


br
br
br
br
br
br
`--------That was a life without anything.\

br
br
` Although even time spent on forming relationships with others was considered wasted when he could be doing research, he was never rewarded.@
` No, not never rewarded, he didn't even have such unnecessary thoughts.@
` The old man only pursued the process.@

` He just wanted to learn endlessly.@
` That was the whole life of the magus.@
` Of course, such life could not have been happy.\

` The magus looked far away with one hand on her, and without another word, ended his long, long life.\

br
br
br
br
` It was an ending without meaning.@
` Since it was a life without any meaning, it could not have been otherwise.\


br
br
br
br
` But at the end the magus failed.@
` Although it was unconsciously, he should not have touched her.@
` Because through that he died as an old man rather than as a magus.\


br
br
br
br
br
br
`------------Without knowing the reason, she cried.\

br
br
br
br
` It was too much.@

` My penis that was dried up from the heat gets wet from the girl's saliva, and becomes an object even more unfitting for her.\


` This is definitely a remarkable service.@

` Perhaps my engorged penis is too big for the girl's small hands.@ She looks too lovely trying desperately to hold onto it with both hands.\


`"|| Ng|| like that, don't move."@
` And so I moved my fingers.@
` I stroked the girl's young back and put my palms onto her heated stomach.@
`"||, || Uh!"@

`"It's okay, I won't do anything scary."@
` Whispering into her ear, I move aside her hair and kiss the back of her neck.\

` Sticking out my tongue from between my lips that are against the back of her neck, I start to lick the girl's neck.\

` As if to stop that, I move my hand that is on her stomach.@
` Spreading apart my fingers, I move my hand back and forth on her flat stomach.@

`"||, ||||"@
` Haaaa, she breathes out.@
` The girl who had been clamping down her teeth until now shows a different type of exhaustion than before.@
`"What the, already---"@
` I feel plenty of stickiness on my fingertips.@

` Her petal-like labia is saturated with lubricants for receiving the male organ.\


`"------Ng."@

`"Let's begin.@ Come here---"@
` I say the name that I can't remember.@
` She gives her whole body to me, and I receive it.@
` Putting my lips against her small back, embracing her slender legs, as she wanted, I impale the girl's body.\

`"Ah-------ah!"@

` From the excessively intense feeling, my mind goes white.\

`----Still only the tip.@
` The moment it went into her small thing, definitely not designed to receive my thing, I was overcome with a feeling that couldn't even be compared to when she was caressing it.\


`"Haaa|| ah, ku||!"@
` The hot mass that immediately shoots up from the root.@
`"Haaa----ah|| ha----"@
` Embracing and stopping the girl's body, somehow I suppress that feeling.\
`"Le---n, you|"@
` I have a hard time speaking.@
` || Really, it's senseless.@
` Twisting open her tight walls, I force in my penis as if impaling the girl.@
` From just that.@
` From just that, even though I haven't gone inside her, through my penis, electric waves of pleasure are sent to my brain.\

` But that does not seem to matter to her.@
`"|| Uh||!"@
` Gasping for breath, she is desperately resisting the pain.@
` From the shame of opening up her legs and the pain of trying to receive something that couldn't possibly go in, she is just painfully trying to breathe.\
br
` Ng|| ah----
br
` Her sigh has that kind of feeling.@
` Pain and shame are simultaneously tormenting her.@
` With her body reddened, she blankly looks at me who is now connected to her.\


`"|||||| Uh."@
` Still, she doesn't resist.@
` Putting strength into her toes, she is shaking, trying only to receive my entire self.@

` Does it hurt, I can't even think of saying something like that.@

`"----I'll continue.@ It's okay to jump up, so bear with it."@
`"||||||"@
` She nods slightly.@
` And so, I push myself in deeper.\
`"||||!"@
` Her body jumps up.@
`"Ku-----ku||!"@
` I, too, am clamping down on my teeth.@
` The girl's vagina that swallowed up the shaft was like a drug.\


`"Ku----not yet, not yet||!"@
`"|| Uh, || uh!"@
` I pick up the girl's body and raise it and lower it.\
` My penis that has gone inside shakes up and down.@
` It's not a matter of going in little by little.@
` First of all, the girl's vagina is not big enough for me to go in.@ So this isn't the process of going in, but rather of penetrating through.@ It's like a drill expanding a small hole.@ This violence gives the girl pain before pleasure.\


` Slide, slide.@
` Flesh mix like when tenderizing meat.@
` The sex that above all brings the girl pain.@
`----But to me, it felt so good that I was about to ejaculate.\


`"Ha----uh||!"@
` I think I'm going to go crazy.@
` Her vagina is not ordinary.@
` Each wall, no, each cell is like a demonic spirit designed to suck in men.@
` They stick and press, they boil us together, and I am squeezed with great pain.@
` It's to the point that it feels like this hot vessel of meat is trying to melt my penis.\


`"Ha-------ah, ku-------uh!"@
` Feeling like I'm going to be completely immersed, I somehow pulled myself away from the pleasure.@
` But my glans is still inside the girl, and my arms, overcome by the pleasure, push the girl down and force me inside again.@
`----All I can do with what little reasoning power I have left is to try to delay my orgasm.\


` There is no going back.@
` My arms grab her legs roughly, and the piston motion becomes faster and faster.@
`"||, ||, ||Uh|"\
` Each time, her breaths become hotter and hotter.@
` Her white skin becomes redder as her blood flows.@
` My penis that keeps opening up the piece of meat.@
` The sigh of the girl who is desperately trying to receive that.\


`"Haaa|| ah, uh|| uuuuh!"@
`---So, there is no way for this to end simply.@
` Her insides coil around me.@
` The ripples that grab and try to melt my penis that is going inside her over and over again like a piston.@
` For a penis, just grazing against it increases sensitivity.\
` But to this girl, there is something more, and for her, pleasure is something else.@
`----The moment it goes in, the feeling of being exposed.@
` In one moment we are entangled, and her walls that squeeze connect me with her and relentlessly bring pleasure to our brains.\


`"Hu-----ku, uh|| uh!"@
` To say that it is sent directly to the brain is not a metaphor.@
` My reasoning power as well as consciousness are beginning to melt.\
` At first, I was fearful of this limitless pleasure.@
` But once my body realized what that was, I couldn't stop.@
`"Uh----hu, ku----!"@
`"||, ||||||!"@
` Screaming, she is bearing with my movements.@
` My penis is now more than halfway in and is filling up the girl's vagina.\


` I thrust upwards with my hips.@
` The sound of meat spreading, the sound of fluid mixing with fluid, barely keep my paralyzed reasoning power in the present.\


`"||||, |||| Uh."@
` And then, she moved.@
` Her vagina that was only responding up until now begins to move by itself in order to receive me.@
`"Ku-------!"@
` Pleasure that makes me almost bite my tongue.@
`"||||, ng||||"@
` Moaning ecstatically, she lowered her hips in order to swallow me in.\


`"----------, ah."@
` This is too much.@
` My brain has now moved to my penis, and it is being pleasured endlessly.@
` The waves of the shaking piece of meat, bathed by her vagina.@
` So it's too much.@ Because in some sense, this is what's called brainwashing.\


`"No----no more"@
` I can't resist it.@
` My penis that is splitting her vagina still hasn't gone in to the root.@
` So, I have to keep spreading it little by little, but there is no way that that would be possible.@
`"||||||"\
` Breathing deeply, she looks down on herself.@
` There is her abdomen, swollen up.@
` Her small body was now filled up, all the way to her limits.@
` And still, my thing hasn't all gone in.@
`----It's getting there.@
` Like this, I want to fill her up completely with my thing, I am overcome by that urge----\


`"Le-----n"@

` One reason was truly unlike me.@
` || The person who should have returned did not come back.@
` It wasn't that that idle time was painful, but rather that I grew to hate myself for becoming used to that idleness, and thus ran away to this place where the person I wait for could not be expected to appear.@ How truly unlike myself.\

` Walking down the moderately new, but still old-fashioned, hallway.@
` Asagami Private Girls Academy has counted fifty years since its founding, and this dormitory has counted about as many.@
` The school buildings were renovated years ago to give the appropriate outward appearance for a noted boarding school, but this dormitory as yet maintains the same wooden construction that it had fifty years before.@ Although that too was true only until last year and now the reconstruction of this dormitory proceeds bit by bit.@
` During this winter break, the dormitory started being rebuilt from the first floor up.@
` By summer, reconstruction will be complete, and I suppose that will be farewell to the old building.\

` Asagami Girls Academy generally requires its students to live in the dormitories, so most of the student body has lived here.\

` Surrounding the dormitory is a grove of trees.@
` Because that grove is basically a high encircling wall, there are only two gates of any size to allow passage from the grounds to the outside.@
` Engraved on the main gate is the phrase "Abandon All Youth, Ye Who Enter Here," a phrase which I think I have heard something similar to before.\
` The truth of that phrase is made obvious by the end of the second day in the dormitory.@
` The staff, who are never seen to crack a single joke, may seem quite capricious at times, but of course that graffiti was carved by some graduate.\

` Because of that, I thought my roommates would have returned already, but Souka and Hanepin's bags are missing.\

` Asagami Girl's Academy is a famous school with a long and proper history.@
` School regulations are very strict, and that strictness is unchanged here in the dormitory.@
` First off, curfew is very strictly enforced.@ Those with club activities must return before 6pm, those without must return by 5pm.\

` At 6:30pm, all residents line up in the hallway and proceed in order to the dining room, where private conversation is prohibited during the meal.@
` When the meal is over, each grade is allowed a period to use the baths, and the Friends Room opens.@
` The 'Friends Room' is a large public room that the students may use freely, and they frequently go here for after dinner tea and conversation.@
` Since this dormitory is one in which private luxuries are forbidden, the only place that one may enjoy tea is the Friends Room.\

` The Friends Room is managed by a member of the school staff, and upon request she will provide tea or desserts.@ There are no restrictions on the number one may request, nor is there any charge, but with all the surrounding eyes, it is not a place one can feel at home.\

` Those who use the Friends Room are mostly the middle schoolers, and those first years who have only recently risen from middle school.@
` Second and third years who are used to the dormitory lifestyle have usually figured out a number of ways to sneak tea and snacks into individual rooms for private tea parties.\

` In the dormitory, naturally various groups tend to form, and once a week the head of each group gathers for a special tea.@
` Of course, these groups do not get along, so the school culture changes depending on how much influence is wielded in those meetings.\

` And thus, because I am a member of the Student Council, I have little influence in the dormitory.@
` That the school belongs to the Student Council and the dormitory to the Student Government has long been the tradition of the Asagami Academy.\

` In these ways, everyone passes three hours of free time before retiring for the evening.@
` If studying, then room lights may remain lit until 11pm, but there are few students who take this rule at face value.\

` Dormitory rooms are assigned at three people to one room.@
` There are special exceptions to these assignments, and the highest ranking students, the group leaders, have single rooms.@
` Those so chosen are thought to have special privileges and this is one way to show them in this small world of the school.\

` Last year, for only a few weeks, I transferred to another school.@
` Unlike the Asagami Girl's Academy, that school was not another academy sealed away from the outside world, but instead a typical public school.@
` That unled, unordered and muddled atmosphere was not something I liked, but neither did I dislike it.@
` Compared to that school, Asagami's unusual, no, anachronistic status was made plain to me, and because of that I had largely lost interest in the influence battles within the dormitory.\

` || Oh, yes.@
` This may be a digression, but a cafeteria where students may decide what to consume or vending machine where one may acquire a drink at any time are absent from Asagami.@
` Those things may be convenient, but their lack is no particular inconvenience.\

br
br
`----It was, in all points, a story of mysteries.@
br
` Anecdotes that spring from some unknown events in this old school's history.@
` Such as, an embryo floating in formaldehyde in the specimen room, !w1000
br
` such as, the voices of the dead heard from broken red telephone, !w1000
br
` such as, an unaddressed letter being delivered and granting a wish.\

` Shijou Tsukasa's story was, among those, one of the relatively quieter ones, one of those Seven Mysteries that even now certain students use as a fun diversion.\

` | A rather embarrassing story, but this will do as a summary:\

` There are places in the dormitory where the mail is delivered.@ Remnants from the school's founding, there are mail boxes at either end of each floor, adjacent to the reception desk, in the courtyards, pretty much walk for a little while and you will run into one.@
` Among those, the mail box that is said to be the oldest is the one in the rear courtyard.\

` Why this story ever began, I do not know, but supposedly| Using a purple envelope, without the sender's name or an addressee on it, put nothing inside but a paper with a single wish written on it, and drop the letter into that mail box.@
` Then, should that letter be returned to you, seven days later, in exchange for something important to you, your wish will be granted.@ A ghost story fairly typical of this sort of girl's school.\

` I believe I have already mentioned it, but even before Shijou Tsukasa began her explanation, this was a story I knew well.\

` 'What a pain,' I muttered, then remembered Souka's words.\

br
` '---You're cold to strangers.'@
br
` || That is, certainly, true.@
` I'm just that sort of person.@ Actually, if HE hadn't been there, I would be cold to everyone.\

` I've always had that coldness in me.@
` I thought it was simply impossible that anyone would ever love me.@
` But then, when did I start to enjoy being with others and sharing our troubles?\

` || I didn't want to be hated.@
` Because I inherited the Tohno blood, no matter what I did I could not be like others.@
` Utterly pointless to try.@ If no matter how I tried to smooth things over I could never be the same, then I would accept my differences and build a wall between us.@ That's how people like me live, the method we know to protect ourselves.\

` But I never wanted to be hated.@
` That's why I, even my normally cold self, would act like HIM occasionally.@
` I thought that if I could laugh with others, and make others laugh, then at least I would share the same feelings.\

` Thus I began my disguise.@
` But that disguise was more pleasant than I had expected and before I knew it, I had lost track of what was acting and what was truly me, and before I knew it, I had become this Tohno Akiha that others know.\

` I am myself, after all.@
` That coldness in me, which I thought was my strength, upon inspection might actually be rather warm.\

` But even so,@
` that I could ever learn to feel the warmth of others is all because of HIM.@
` To me, Tohno Akiha, HE is my irreplaceable other half.@ Should I ever lose him, I would probably return to the cold, perverse self from long ago that knew no other way to live.\

`"------Haaa."@
` That's why, seduced by my own weakness, I sent that letter.@
` I made a purple envelope, and left my wish to incubate in that mail box.@
` | But in the end, I couldn't think of it as anything more than a simple prayer, and so I did not write a single word on that paper.@
` The envelope's contents were just a blank sheet of paper.@
` | If the Seven Mysteries were true, and the curse of purple letter was real, then people must think Tohno Akiha to be a truly cold person.\

` Subsequently, I could hear Shijou Tsukasa's shouts.@
` Other students, wondering what was happening, began to look into the corridor.@
`"-----What a bother."@
` Like this, if I were to force my way into the room, there is no telling what sort of rumors may start.@

`"Good morning.@ I am so sorry for creating such a fuss so early in the morning."@
` Making a first-rank smile I responded to the speaker.@

`"Um, Tsukasa| Would you please not take offense?@ Last night she was injured again, and has been more and more neurotic lately."@

`"I am aware of that.@ I had heard from the Dorm manager that Shijou-san has not been well lately.@ || How is last night's injury?"\
`"| Well, she won't let any of us see it.@ Anzou|@, that is, Tsukasa's roommate, well, Anzou got chased out of the room, and Tsukasa has been closed up in there ever since then.@
` It was a pretty bad burn, so I guess she just doesn't want other people to see it."@
`"----That makes sense.@ Burns are not something to go around showing other people.@ If I were in Shijou-san's place, I would not go out in public until I was completely healed."\

`"Eh? Ah, Tohno-san, if you say so| You're not angry?"@
`"It's a neurosis, is it not?@ Those sorts feel no resentment for sympathy.@ So, everyone be sure not to excite Shijou-san, and treat her gently until she is pieced together again."@
` Or, at least, I want to be able to ignore her for the next two days.\

`"| Uwaaa.@ Tohno-san, ever since you returned, you've become so serene.@ It's quite a difference."@
`"Is that so?@ I have not changed at all, though."@
` 'Really?' the student seemed to question, then returned to her room.@
`"Ah, there is one thing I forgot to ask."@
`"Hm, what is it, Tohno-san?"@
`"Where was Shijou-san injured?@ On her face? Or was her hair burned?"@
`"Eeeeeeeh?"@
` After looking at me wonderingly for a moment, she responded that the burn was on Shijou Tsukasa's arm.\

` Taking advantage of break periods, I learned the details of last night's events.@
` While my roommates and I had been frolicking about in our room, Shijou Tsukasa had been in the Friends Room, chatting.@
` Having lost a bet, Shijou Tsukasa was forced to serve tea to everyone, when some sort of trouble occurred.@ As a result, she was burned on one arm.\


` At that moment, there was no one else in the kitchen, so precisely why she was burned was unclear.@
` Not even whether it was caused by the gas burners, or perhaps by bumping against the hot stove.@
` Just that the burn was not serious enough to require treatment at a hospital.\

`"That's obvious.@ No matter what you do, there is simply no way to seriously hurt yourself in the Friends Room, geesh."@

`"I believe that 'curses' really do exist."@
` I suddenly declared while bandaging my scraped elbow.\

`"Curses?@ You mean, the Seven Mysteries?@ Didn't we decide that was just superstition?"@
`"Not the Seven Mysteries.@ Whether coincidence or contrived, I was thinking that should the cycle be done just right, that it is possible to curse someone.@
`  Imagine that A hates B, and A decides 'Well, then, OK' and one day creates a 'cursed' situation so that B will die.@ That's what I was thinking of."\

`"| What's with that?@ In other words, A hates B, so A hires a hitman.@ Then, on the appointed day, the hitman sticks B's feet in concrete and drops her in the ocean.@ Is that what you mean?"\

bg "image\event\yume_e15d.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid

`"No, not at all.@ That is nothing more than going through the motions.@ That's not doing it yourself, fulfilling your objective without ordering others to act in your stead.@
` What I'm talking about is that 'situation.'@ A situation where A, who wishes to kill B, and B, who knows nothing of A, share in the same risk.@
`  For example, let us say this room was full of landmines."\

`"Whoa, this conversation is getting extreme all of a sudden."@
`"I'm just making it easy to understand, alright?@
` So, then, these landmines really have no existence in the real world.@ As long as you live your normal life, they won't explode.@ However, should you do something removed from your normal life| For example, if Hanei should use my comb, or if you used my towel, Souka, then those abnormal actions would cause you to accrue points.@ Of course, I, too|@
`  Well, I would never do so, but if I were to steal Hanei's precious cookies and eat them, then I, too, would accrue points."\


`"| Got it.@ And when that point total crosses a certain level, then the land mines react?@ Is that the plan?"@
`"To put it simply, yes.@ Those originally unlikely actions form, in other words, an accumulation of coincidences and chance events, correct?@
` Should those chance events, those 'switches,' be pushed again and again, then the 'situation' would become a changing stage.@ That is what I think a 'curse' is.\

bg "image\event\yume_e15e.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid

` As another example, should Hanei wish to use my comb, she would have to stand near my dresser, and since she weighs five kilos more than I do, that would place an additional burden on the floor.@ Should this happen ten times, the floor would mysteriously break, causing the room to collapse, and the pitiful Mizawa Hanei would be singing with the angels."\

`"I see, but that's just sophistry.@ I mean, if the room could be destroyed by something like that, then you and I would be dead twenty times over."\


`"Right!@ That's why setting up the room to act like that would be a 'curse.'@ Both the one who created the curse and those who participate must always watch out to see if the circumstances of the curse are about to be fulfilled.@ And because she is participating as well, the curse will show obvious hostility to its creator as well.@
` To say that a curse is a double-edged blade is accurate, for in such a situation, whether A or B will fall is uncertain."@

` Ah, what a rambling delusion I'm spouting off.\

`"| Hmm.@ So what you want to say is that the superstition of the Seven Mysteries is a 'curse' like that?@ But then, whose curse is it?@
` By what you said, the situation is something man-made, not something natural, right?"@
`"Just as sharp as always, Souka.@ | Well, this Purple Envelopes thing would be a natural occurring curse, I guess.@ But this particular curse's 'switch' is quite uncommon, so normally it would never come to completion."\

` I began bandaging my other elbow.@
` This was the result of a dramatic fall during my return to the dormitory.\

`"Ah!@ You're doing that again?@ Geesh, Akiha-chan, why have you been so beat up lately?"@

`"Uwa!@ That looks painful.@ Akiha-chan, you've been getting hurt constantly.@ But you said you haven't been fighting, so what have you been doing?"@
` Brimming with curiosity, Hanepin gazed at my elbows.@
` Then,
`"Ah!@ This has got to be a curse!"@
` was her instant answer.\

`"-------Eh?!"@
` Two voices in harmony.

` I applied disinfectant to the scrape on my arm, and continued.@
`"To tell the truth, I, too, sent out a letter and had it returned.@ That was five days ago, the same day the Shijou-san did."\

`"-------?"@
` Hanepin, uncomprehending, merely looked confused.@
`"Wahahahahaha!@ That's just too funny!"@
` Souka, well, just as expected, grabbed her stomach and exploded in mirth.\


`"|| Souka.@ Some laughter may be expected, but laughing that hard is a little annoying?"@
`"No, nonononono, it's just, that you too have only two days to live!"@
` Souka collapsed in laughter, falling to the floor.@
` || Hmph.@ To have my peerless friend be someone like this, I truly am cursed.\

` This is a being hiding inside her consciousness, waiting for a time to fuse with her.\


`"It is an honor meeting you, Brunestud.@ I never thought I'd have the chance to speak with you like this.@ Anyway, with you in this state, it seems to me that it will be difficult for the princess to succeed the Crimson Moon."@

ld c,":a;image\tachi\hime_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid
`"You are still skilled with words, priest.@ Why not see if you could free her with that tongue?@ You were able to make her drink blood, maybe you would be able to unbind these chains."@
`"I politely refuse.@ What would I do after unbinding the chains?@ I have no way to keep her in control."\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\hime_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid
`"But it would be of reference?@ By your method, the increasing impurity would result in ruin.@ A human soul cannot withstand the outside world without a body.@ Even if you've become a Dead Apostle, you can't escape corrosion as long as your base is human.@
` So, like myself, you must prepare a successor.@ Only when a body of my scale is spawned does the Crimson Moon manifest.@ That way, there is no need to repeat useless steps and become simplified as in your case."\


`"About that matter, I desire that simplification.@ I want to cut off the useless 'self,' to keep its influence as minimal as possible.@
` I do not wish to maintain a world-corrosive will as in your case, Brunestud."\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\hime_t01.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid
`"You speak bold words.@ Do you mean to say that you understand what I am?"@
`"I do not understand.@ What I do know, though, is that your process is not very effective.@ After you were born as the ultimate being, the ones born after you were all too imperfect.@
` You were the only one that went right, and all the other True Ancestors were just failures, weren't they?@ So you decided to modify this.@ The True Ancestors are just a phenomenon that occurs by need, but you taught them how to create it with their own hands.@
` The reason is simple.@ You desperately needed a True Ancestor of the same degree of purity as yourself."\


`"---Continue."@
`"It means that your life is reaching its end.@ To the True Ancestors, who do not have a predetermined lifespan, death is something that results from an external event.@
` You had too many enemies.@
` Generally, the True Ancestors are accepted as a spirit of nature.@ That's why the beast of Alaya won't oppose them.@
` | The True Ancestors are more than just an enemy of the human race.@ They are the keepers of nature as well.@ Our subconsciousness both accepts and denies the monster called the True Ancestors, so Alaya's beast does not recognize them as a target of elimination."\


`"However you, the original, were different.@
` The Crimson Moon cannot exist by Gaia or Alaya.@ You foresaw the upcoming modifications, and you needed to find a body to prepare for the extermination."\


`"Even then, you wouldn't have imagined that you, a True Ancestor, would be defeated by a human.@
` You were too late in recognizing magic, the rule outside the rules.@ That's why you were surpassed by the old man of jewels.@
` Because of that unexpected event, you were exterminated just before the perfection of a successor.@
`---Leaving behind a reality marble that will spawn the True Ancestors, a 'seed' in which you can embed yourself."\


ld c,":a;image\tachi\hime_t02.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid
`"||||"@
`"The 27 ancestors are no more than a footprint that you made in this world.@ No matter how much you tried, a True Ancestor of your level of purity would not be born.@ So you began to test out other possibilities.@
` One of the results would be Altrouge Brunestud, but even she hasn't reached a level high enough to succeed the Crimson Moon| no, since she has Gaia's Beast under her control, she may be even more powerful than the Crimson Moon in a way, but Altrouge herself is too unstable."\


`"Then, a true successor was spawned naturally, a method that you had given up by then.@
` After the death of the Crimson Moon, the True Ancestors, who the Crimson Moon had scorned upon, had succeeded in creating a perfect body.@ Something that the Crimson Moon was unable to produce.@
` That is Arcueid Brunestud.@
` However, she has put herself in chains, so it seems that she's not at a state to accept you in."\


`"Interesting.@ Then what do you think I am?@ If she's not accepting the Crimson Moon, do you mean to say I am not the Crimson Moon?"\


`"Certainly.@ Every True Ancestor has a place inside him to accept the Crimson Moon.@ It is a rule that you made yourself.@
` But that's just an aspect of the Crimson Moon.@ Every True Ancestor is an incarnation of the Crimson Moon, but at the same time, a totally different being.@ For this reason, the princess who is talking with me right now is no more than a shadow of Arcueid Brunestud.@
`---You are not yet confirmed as the Crimson Moon.@
` As long as Arcueid Brunestud is called Arcueid Brunestud, you cannot be the Crimson Moon."\



`"Hm.@ If what you say is true, then it certainly makes sense that I exist in this manner.
` | Indeed, I am just a hologram that has a possibility.@ It was I who didn't know where I stand.@ And to think I was planning to take over."@
`"No, there's no need to be so dishearted.@ Since Arcueid Brunestud is bound in chains, she will give up her name in a while.@
` Then, that empty body will be yours.@ You told me to free her, but it's actually the opposite.@ If the Crimson Moon is to reincarnate, it's best to leave her as she is."\

` There is a thing called a 'Demon.'@
` Even though it exists within the rule of nature, here is a power that isn't needed because it is said to disrupt its flow.@
` There are many types of them, but they will all appear evil for someone who is within the straight flow.\


` A Demon is a disruption and Demon Hunters are a gathering of those who fix the disruption.@
` But disruption isn't of a single type.@
` The Demon Hunters fix disruptions within nature but can't fix the disruption within humans.\

` For example, there is a type of Demon called the 'Ogre.'@
` This is a type that isn't in the straight flow from the beginning, and clearly a genuine Demon.@ The Demon Hunters are fit to banish them, but it's a different story when these Ogres mix with humans.\
` Because the Demon Hunters are an organization in the lawful spell branch, created by humans to protect the human society, they are not supposed to hurt humans.@
` For that reason, they will have a difficult time against a mix of Demon and human.\


` A long time ago, there were many who wished to become hybrids with the Demons, who are greater beings, and as a result, a few of them made that possible.@
` Using the power of the Demons even as a human, they sometimes help the Demon Hunters while sometimes they become their worst enemies.@
` That ratio is very fragile.@
` The hybrids who place themselves with the Demon Hunters and the hybrids who oppose the Demon Hunters hate each other, and they continue to fight below the surface.@
` Of course, the Demon Hunters oppose the hybrids as well.\


` But as a general principle, Demon Hunters are those who fix the disruption.@
` Demons are disruptions just by existing, so they banish them right away.@
` But Demon-human hybrids are not a disruption.@
` In order for a hybrid to be considered a disruption, the demon blood needs to become thicker than the human blood.@
` These Demon Hybrids who can't maintain the human side anymore are seen as being out of alignment, and the Demon Hunters finally see them as their target.\


` However, when the hybrids go out of alignment, they become the worst enemy for the Demon Hunters.@
` Because they have a human side, binding spells won't work on them, and because they have the alien power of the demons, it's impossible to stand up against them with a body of a human.@
` In the past when weapons were undeveloped, killing them meant many casualties.
br
`-------------However.@
`             There was a special case.\


bg "image\bg\cmo_19.jpg",%type_crossfade_mid

` Psychic ability.@
` Even though the Demons and the Demon Hunters oppose each other, their powers actually originate from the same place.@
` Therefore, there is a common rule between them and they have a fair fight within its bounds.@
` But rarely, there are ones who are outside of the rule.@
` Those are the alien powers called 'psychic abilities,' and the psychics.\


` They don't follow the rules of 'Demons' and carry inhuman powers as pure humans.@ Some say that this is a suppressing power that was born from the unconsciousness of mankind.@
` The targets of the suppression are, no doubt, ones who are threat to the humans, who're the highest primates.@
br
` People who achieved these abilities don't need to study an out-of-date technology like sorcery.@
` Ignoring the principle of Yin and Yang, the interaction with nature, psychic ability is an extreme power achieved by the human race, who became detached from nature.\


` Without interacting with nature like Demons, they have superhuman power while still being humans.@
` They are just like the hybrids, but instead of borrowing power from alien blood, they are humans born with special abilities.@
` Because they are advanced abilities, they end a single generation after an accidental appearance.@
` Commonly called the psychics, they are the bane of the Demon Hybrids.\

`------To put it simply, the Nanaya clan is a special case of them.@
br
` But note, psychics are not stronger than Demons; It's impossible for them to stand against them.@
` The psychic ability is just a small needle that doesn't follow the rules of the Yin and Yang.@
` Those abilities and effects are extremely small compared to the interaction with nature of the Demons and Demon Hunters, and there is no way a psychic is able to fight them alone.\


` But still, a power outside the rule can be a threat to those who live inside the rule.@
` The Demon Hunters hide their existence in the beginning and use them to catch the hybrids off guard by having them appear in the middle of the battle.@
` It's kind of like saying a psychic's support is a stone that is thrown between two people glaring at each other.@
br
` The Psychics use their unusual abilities,
` to just once, create a decisive opening in their opponent.@
br
` That's how Demon Hunters use the psychics, and even for the hybrids, they are just a bothersome unpredictable factor.\

` Yes.@

` Since the ancient times, the Nanayas lived for generations without mixing their blood.@
` Many hideous children were born for being incestuous, but the ones who were able to grow up became powerful.@
` Repeating that single blending was the reason they were able to solidly carry on their psychic abilities, which are supposed to be a mutational gene that lasts only for one generation.\


` On top of that, the Nanayas polished their skills as assassins and learned a way to bring the psychics, who were normally on a suicide mission, home alive.@
` As a result,
` we have the Nanaya clan with power outside the boundary of a human, and the human body trained to the limit.@
` At that point, they were not considered a clan with psychic ability, but a clan which is specifically given the title of Demon Hunters.\


` That was the only way for the Nanaya family, who were psychics discriminated against even more than the hybrids at times, to show their usefulness and live.@

` By stretching the thin thread around, changing the monster's lair into his own hunting ground, he killed his prey one by one.@
` Of course there could't be any murderous intentions or tensions.@
` For the head of the Nanayas, this hunting ground was his daily routine.\

` He took out another three.@
` The thing in Kiri's hand was only a steel drumstick.@
` He liked to use this plain weapon and he used it to thrust into the vital spots of a human.@
` That was a savage way of killing, far from the superior assassination skill called the pressure point.@ With the point of the stick that is neither thin nor thick, he crushed the bones instead of the muscle.@ At times, he thrust at the opponent's head from above and caused the head to be pushed into the body.@
` Like his name said, his weapon was more like a giant awl than a drumstick.@
` It couldn't cut, but it could make holes.@
` As a result, it was rare that he got stained with the blood of his enemy like this.\


`"----hmph"@
` Kiri shook off the blood by wielding the drumstick.@
` There were only two more people in the mansion.@ He was planning to spill the smell of blood here to alarm his prey, but he ended up drilling a hole into one with extra high tension.@
br
`"| disgusting blood.@ It even smells nasty."@
br
` The irritated assassin said to himself.@
` Getting showered by blood, Nanaya Kiri stopped his footsteps for the first time.@
` He didn't like blood, thinking that the sticky red color might bring down his precision.\



` Nanaya Kiri found no pleasure in killing.@ He took this path just because he was born into the Nanaya family and was physically fitter than his siblings.@
` He wasn't like his older brother who enjoyed killing, nor like his younger sister who was highly sensitive to Demons and feared them.@
` To say the least, he was the type of person who dedicates himself to one thing.\


` How skillfully he could put a stop to a human body.@
` That pursuit was a duty for those born in the Nanaya family, and Nanaya Kiri was just doing that single-mindedly.@
` When he noticed, there was no one who was better than him, and after he was chosen as the head, he just kept on killing the mixed beings every day for years.\

` If you look back, that's all there was to his life.@
` But Kiri never felt it as a burden.@
` The only thing on his mind was how skillfully he could kill someone.@
` That was the only meaning to his life, since he was born as a Nanaya.\



`"----The eighth guy went pretty good.@ I'll try that again when I get home."@
` Out of the thirty people he had killed today, Kiri recalled the one he was able to kill the quickest.@
` There was no enjoyment or pain.@
` Nanaya Kiri lacked those emotions.@
` Therefore, he was suited for being the head of the Nanayas.@
` Not enjoying or fearing murder.@
` But being able to concentrate on it is the natural talent of a killer.\

` That killer suddenly felt something strange.@
` An foreign object entered his view, which had been perceiving only two more people.@
br
`---------There was a vermilion flow inside this mansion.@
br
` Nanaya Kiri was able to perceive people's thoughts.@
` Thoughts are waves, and most of them have a dull transparent color, in which emotions can be lightly read by the speed of its flow.@
` But there are some with their own color.@
` Those are monsters that are too horrifying to be described as a 'human.'@ As far as Kiri knew, there were a few in the Demon Hunter Organization with a divine color of blue and silver.\


` This was vermilion.@
` No, if I approach its body I'll probably perceive a clearer red.@
` Kiri had never seen a thought that strong, a thought that wicked.@
br
`"-------------"@
br
` Without finishing to wipe the blood that still dripped from his hair, Nanaya Kiri started walking.\

` This man was the eldest son of a hybrid family and knew the head of the Saiki family.@
` But unlike Saiki, he cooperated with the Demon Hunters.@ Because for him, his family's safety was a lot more important than the pride of his ancestors.@
` And he secretly formed an alliance with the Demon Hunter Organization and worked under Saiki while he kept an eye on him and made reports.\


` It was he who was reporting that Saiki ate human flesh and that there were more than a thousand casualties.@
` Originally Saiki was the old type of hybrid full of dominance, and from the view of a hybrid who just wanted to live peacefully like this one, he was just an annoying old man.@
` On top of that, if this old man who was a dictator died, the Saiki group cooperation would have a hole in it.@ It was his ambition as a businessman to make use of it.@

` That's how the man sold the Saiki bloodline,

` He was only a small child, so he was satisfied with this size.@

` He wasn't very comfortable being with the others in the first place.@
` Because his eyes were special, and it was an eye that seemed to look into the inner side of people.@

` The boy was in a dark traditional Japanese room.@
` This was the space he was given since he was little, and this was the only space in which he was able to be free.@
` The boy was only a small child, so I think he was satisfied with this size.@
` The boy glares at the empty space as if he's complaining that it was too big.\


` The boy didn't understand people in the first place.@
` Their behaviors, expressions, words; He didn't understand anything well.@
` The boy thought he must not be a human, but a dog.@
` There was a severe gap that if that wasn't it, he might have gone crazy.@
` That gap wasn't solved until the boy met the same type of person as him.\


` Everyone called him a Demon Child.@
` They were a clan that continued to mix with a pure Demon called an Ogre in the first place, but once the boy who preserved the desired purity was born, the clan desperately tried to hide his existence.@
` Even they, who were not normal, must have realized that he wasn't something that should be born.@
` So the sins of their bloodline over several hundred years had finally taken shape in their generation.\


` Those who were called the Kishimas finally realized that they were taking the path to destruction when they got there.@
` No doubt, that is where all the bloodlines of the hybrids end.@
` They were just,
` terribly slower than the others,
` or terribly earlier.\


` The boy was never taught anything.@
` No one talked to him in the first place, so there was no need to learn words, and there was never a need to tell others his thoughts either.@
` The boy's vicious eyes pull out the inner side of people.@
` Most of the people who met him were nothing but terrified.@ That's how the boy learned that people were like that, and since they only act like that, there was no need for him to learn words.@
br
` It was only natural.\


` The boy liked the forest and wished to be among the animals.@
` They didn't allow that.@ Even if it was just out of formality, they couldn't let the successor of the family live in such way.@
` More than anything, it must have been an embarrassment for them to have the next head of the family wishing to live like a beast.@
` But the boy wasn't a fool like they were thinking, and he matured pretty fast.@
` The boy knew how to seal his power early on, and as a matter of fact, he never opened his cage since he was born.\


` That was like a fasting that began right when he was born.@
` The boy just kept on suppressing his thirst and the beast called himself.@
` Normally, the bloodlust only happens after growing up as a human and finding something in need of protection.@
` The Inversion Impulse that the boy's bloodline experiences destroys the person within a year, even the mind of an adult.\


` The boy was withstanding that quietly.@
` It should have been impossible for a child who does not know words and does not know what a family is.@
` In other words, the boy was trying to protect his family without even knowing.@
` Father, mother, siblings; He doesn't know how those things are related with himself.@
` But he was suppressing himself to protect them.@
` That's probably because he knew that someday returning to soil peacefully after being forgotten like that was the right thing.\


` But that didn't last long.@
` The one who put an end to it was someone other than the boy.@
br
`---------You were out of your mind since you were born.@

` Receiving that curse, the boy was shot in the head with a bullet.@

br

` This is a man he knew from way back.@ Even after Kiri left the Organization, he couldn't just forget about him and secretly told him about the assault.@

` This being the first hunting in a long while, Kiri sharpened his eyes.@
`"Kiri, didn't you leave the organization to break away from that job?@ You knew that assassins were no longer needed anymore, isn't that why you went out of your way and left?@ If that's the case-----"@
`"Heh, stop preaching.@ Why is it that I have to listen to your lectures when I just came in for a treatment.@ Here, stop talking and start working, you quack.@ I got my shoulders busted working as a bodyguard when I haven't done so in a while."\


`"| I don't understand.@ Someone is after you when you're supposed to have quit, but you're minding your own business and taking on a job as a body guard for Tohzaki.@ No, because you do odd things like that, there are fools who start seeing the Nanayas as problematic."@
`"How can I help it, we've known the Tohzakis since the previous head.@ Besides, they actually got some money.@ It was a pretty good job."@
`"Hmph.@ I thought you settled down after you had a child, but you haven't changed.@ I heard you were a fond father, but I'm starting to be suspicious."@
`"---------Shut up.@ Forget that.@ Hurry up and finish it."@
` Kiri didn't speak any more and the doctor treated him quietly.\


` And suddenly, 
`"Hey, old man,"@
` The assassin once feared as the Demon God raised a voice in an extremely calm tone.\


`"People's lives are very well made."@
`"Oh?@ What makes you say that?"@
`"Nothing, I just felt that way."@
` Muttering that, Kiri stopped talking.@
br
`----------Six years ago.@
` As the head of the Nanayas, he had a child.@
` In order to maintain the precision of being assassins, they made the generation transition early.@
` By the time their physical ability started to decline, their child had already matured, and the name of Nanaya is succeeded to the next generation.@
` His elder brother and younger sister already had children, and they were receiving training as the potential successor.@
` Compared to them, Kiri had a child quite late.\


` The reason Kiri never had a child was because he simply didn't find the need to do so.@
` He was just thinking of having his elder brother or younger sister's children be the successor.@
` For Kiri, who only had an interest in how to kill people, a thing such as a child was totally beyond understanding.@
br
` No, maybe Kiri already knew.@
` That he was a person who grew up while still remaining a child.@
` A person who concentrated in one thing, chipping off everything needed as a human being.@ A person who was only looking at what he liked.@ An inexperienced child who only knew about one thing.\

` There was no way such a child could raise a son, and obviously he never even imagined it.@
` In other words, a child was something excessive and not needed for Nanaya Kiri.@
br
`---------That was before he saw his own son.\


` Kiri was thinking he shouldn't feel anything.@
` He never needed it to begin with, so a son had to be something just bothersome.@
` That's why he was thinking of seeing him just once and leaving the rest to the woman.@
br
`--------However, his world flipped over when he saw him.@
br
` It was a transformation that felt like something fell right in its place.@
` Or did the thing that was possessing him since he was born disappear?@
` Either way, the instant Nanaya Kiri saw this living being, he made up his mind to quit his career as an assassin.\


` He probably still doesn't carry such an emotion like loving his child.@
` But he just felt that he needed to, and his life style since that day completely changed.@
` He was a man who only knew how to 'kill people' in the first place.@
` And now he was trying to 'make people live.' This was literally a turning point in life.@
` Kiri had said that people's lives are very well made.@
` That was definitely true, and everything about the ways of making people live were new to him, and difficult.@
` Kiri, who was accustomed to killing, was no longer bored of his life for the past months and years.\


`"Can I ask you something?@ Did you quit because you loved your son?"@
`"No way.@ I quit for myself."@
` That's right.@ If a child is a duplicate copy of one's self.@
`"You didn't want to make him take the same path as you?"@
`"I wanted to see if he is able to take a different path than me."@
` I see, the doctor nodded his head.@
` The treatment is over and Kiri turned his back.\


`"All right, take care.@ If we ever meet again, I might ask for your help."@
` The doctor doesn't answer.@
` After Nanaya Kiri left, the doctor repeats his words.@
`"If he is able to take a different path, eh?"@
` I wonder if the man who said that it was for himself realizes that this emotion was in fact the love of a father.\


`"-----You fool.@ Why did you have to develop a human emotion now."@
` Everything was too late.@
` Finding happiness as a human was a misfortune for that flawless killer.@
br
`"It's impossible for you.@ You'll never be able to attain it."@
br
` Mumbling to himself, the doctor laughed with a sigh.@
` The killer himself must know that more than anyone.@
` That man has already accepted his end that will eventually come.@
` Involving his clan, including his own son, he left the path of being an assassin.\


` Being the head of the Nanayas, he must have known.@
` The Nanayas were able to exist because they were able to be the greatest assassins.@
` | hence, when they go down from the top, that's when the Nanaya clan dies out.@
br
` Just that its arrival came six years slower.@ That was all there was to this story.\

`"So we are unable make contact with the men below?"@
`"--------Yes.@ Additionally, the far-seers have spotted two groups coming in from below.@ They number approximately fifty.@ I'm afraid|"@
`"They must be Tohno's private army.@ Considering their numbers, they probably intend on killing us all."@
` Nanaya Kiri laughed delightedly.@
` There was no feeling of anxiety.@
` A situation where fifty armed men were closing in on this mansion.@
` This place was deep in the mountains, and the landlord from the Organization was already bought by their enemy.@
` They were unable to seek help, and besides, there wouldn't be anyone who'd come to their aid.\


` In this situation, Kiri was laughing.@
` Of course, because he already knew this was coming.@
` No, it would be more accurate to say that he was waiting for this.\


`"But the Tohnos?@ I don't know such fellows.@ I wonder when we incurred their hatred.@ Do you know?"@
`"| No.@ The Tohnos were never our targets.@ Besides, they are on good terms with the organization so there shouldn't have been any instances where we did anything to them."@
`"I see, then it must be some stupid reason.@ Hah, they are funny fellows to throw away their lives like that"@
`"--------Master.@ Are you telling me that you're going out to fight them?"\


`"Of course.@ We need to stop trouble beforehand or it may disturb our sleep.@ If the higher-ups are just going watch this, it'll be better for us.@ No matter how many we kill, they'll clean up after our mess."@
`"| But we won't be able to do that without casualties either.@ Our enemy aren't hybrids but armed people.@ They are skillful and equipped like professional assassins."@
`"Hmph, you're right.@ We won't be able to avoid bullets.@ ----All right, I'll go on ahead and take care of the troublesome ones.@ I'll leave my older brother and the others in charge of disposing of the leftover meals."\


` And so Kiri stood up.@
` There was no need for a report on the enemy routes since Kiri knew the terrain down to the individual trees.@
` If he knew just the direction the enemies were approaching from and where they were headed to, he could naturally figure out their path.\


`"------Master."@
`"What is it?"@
`"What should we do with your son?@ If you order us to do so, we'll risk our lives to take him outside------"@

` That was such a simple and primitive form of destruction with nothing extra.\

` A demonic arm that could destroy him just by touching flew right in front of his eyes.@

` Of course, that had no effect.@
` He'd been repeating it dozens of times, but Kouma's neck wasn't hurt.\


`"----------------------"@
` Kiri was laughing at himself in his mind.@
` You can't even kill one person after all this, and you call yourself the greatest assassin?@
` But there was no need for an embarrassment.@
` If it had been against a normal person, the precise blows would have certainly killed him forty times over.@

` Even so, this is my home, and the fact that I have had no complaints after moving here almost eight years ago shows that humans are tough creatures.@
` On the nameplate is "乾."@
` This reads "Inui."@ It's a pretty uncommon last name, so there is no house besides ours in this residential area with a nameplate that says "Inui."\


`"Wah‾, arrived--"@
` I skipped school this morning, and with nothing to do, I came back home.@
` First of all, because I'm someone who lives in this house.@
` Last name is Inui, first name is Arihiko.@ Since I'm a male, Arihiko (有彦) seems like a simply chosen name.@ My older sister's name is Ichigo (一子), just as simply - I don't even need to explain its origin.@
` And I don't know whether that's simple or exciting, but my parents both died a long time ago in an accident, so there are no others in the Inui household apart from my older sister and me.\


` Since the two of us were left alone about eight years ago, Inui Arihiko grew up as an orphan during the ages most sensitive to influence.@
` However, my older sister, who should have replaced my parents, was an idiot whose life skills did not surpass mine.@
` Maybe she felt something from our parents' deaths, but my older sister showed off stupidity greater than mine by doing whatever she liked, and since I grew up by myself, doing whatever I liked as well, I've become a great delinquent by now.\


` So, today I again only showed up when necessary and quickly escaped the school.@
` If I had any regret, it would be that I failed in convincing a first-year girl to come out with me.@
br
`"---This doesn't seem to end, these days my situation with the girls isn't so good."@

` Since the girls suddenly exploded around that guy who didn't have any girls up until now, I've been constantly failing.@

` When I realized that the entire shack was drifting down, I didn't act surprised, and when a wall or window started squeaking and cracking, I didn't panic.@
` I even went to a corner where no one was, because I was annoyed at the crying of my classmates.\

` But that was a mistake.@
` Suddenly, with a bang, the roof broke.@
` A broken branch stuck to the floor.@
` It fell right in front of my nose, and so my whole mind went white.@
` I was always ready for this kind of accident, but I had become unable to think or move.\


` At that moment.@
br
`"Let's go back to where everyone is.@ I think this place is dangerous."@
br
` Suddenly his face popped up behind the fallen branch.\


`"You-----"@
` 'Aren't you scared at all?,' I tried to say.@
` If he came from behind the branch, that means he was in this area as well.@
` In this situation where one wrong step could mean death, he was unbelievably calm.@
`"We're not hurt.@ I guess we're lucky.@ Now, let's go somewhere safer."@
` 'Let's go,' he said and started going to the center of the shack.\


`"--------"@
` From that I understood a little.@
` I had accepted the irrationality that humans could die at any moment.@ I had decided to live however I wished until then.@
` However, this guy was subtly different.@
` This guy could accept the irrationality of death, but still live with leisure.\


`"|| What an idiot."@
` He's so strange that even I should say that.@
` Maybe it's obvious that I got the feeling he was broken.@
` This guy could be easily ready for death, and then on the next moment move about as if nothing had happened.@
` Thus, can I think anything but that something is wrong with his mind?\

` So after inspecting this ghost by myself, there are two things I've discovered.\


` First of all, it's that it can't survive outside my room, no, actually our house.@
` I don't know the reason, but it seems that her movements are limited to just our house.@
` So it can't even go anywhere else, and it just stays in my room.\


` And second, this ghost is definitely one of poor quality.@  
`"I'll disappear if I'm just left alone.@ Please give me some nutrition."@
` Saying things like that, this horse kept eating the Inui household's food (generally vegetables).@
` 'To be honest, I need a human's energy--,' she complained, but I can't stand to give my energy to a ghost.@
` For that reason, I'm holding back my tears and buying Nanako things to eat with my own money.@ Ichigo just says 'it's yours, so you take care of it,' and her acting just as an onlooker isn't any help at all.\


` || So for these reasons, not only is my mental situation bad, but so is my financial situation.@
` If I live like this for just one more week, I'll have no choice but to start working.@ If that happens, it will get harder to go to school, so I might really have to stay back a year.@
`"This is frustrating.@ How did I get to concern myself over this stuff?"@
` Even extraordinary things need limits.@
` The most absurd thing is my apathy from starting to get used to being around a ghost.\


`"|| Hah.@ Why did I give it a name?"@
` A little bit of regret.@
` Maybe it's just a feeling I'm having, but since I gave it a name, it seems to be following my directions.@
` It's really unlike me.@
` I'm the type of person to do nothing even if someone is starving to death in front of me if he has nothing to do with me, so how did I end up doing something to make it happy?@
` Really, I am truly regretting it.\

` I was driving along a mountain road with Akiha, Hisui, and Kohaku-san in tow.@
` Because my cousin Akiha had wanted to go to the beach, being her partner, I came along as a guardian and as a driver.\

`"This forest sure is deep.@ We've already been in it for an hour, and there's still no end in sight."@
` Sitting in the passenger seat, Akiha complained as usual.@
`"Oh, if you're like that already, what do you plan on doing from now on, Akiha-sama?@ We still have to get past about 5 more mountains before we get to the main road."@
` The person in the back with a map opened up is Kohaku-san.\
`"Shiki-sama.@ The next curve seems particularly harsh, so it might be best to slow down."@
` Sitting next to Kohaku-san and acting as navigator is Hisui.@
` The two of them are maids working at the Tohno house.\

` On the road coming back from a little day trip.@
` We left the beach in the evening, so by the time we had reached the mountain roads, it was already getting dark.@
`"Really, this road sure is gloomy.@ If I had known that it was going to be like this, I would've opted for us to spend the night there."@
` Akiha is restlessly looking out at the road.@
`"Nii-san always has a problem finishing.@ To choose the mountains as the way back, you're unfit to be my fiancee."@
`"Haha, that's good news.@ Then shall we cancel the engagement once we get back?"@
`"Th, there's no way that can happen.@ Our engagement was decided upon by our parents, we can't break it on our own."@
` Akiha turns her head towards the window.\

`"Jeez, you can't do that, Shiki-san.@ Don't make fun of Akiha-sama so much."@
` I can hear Kohaku-san's laughter from the back.@
` ---Akiha and I have been going out since about a year ago.@
` I, Nanaya Shiki, having been born into a family with deep ties to the Tohno family, one day suddenly became engaged to the lone daughter of the boss of the Tohno group.@
` Well, I figured that I was chosen because, having grown up with Akiha as a brother, I had a good relationship with her.\

` But the problem is that I still see Akiha as merely my little sister.@
` I don't know how Akiha sees me, but the reason that I can't openly say that we're in a relationship is because of that reservation.\


`"Nii-san, aren't we going a little too fast?"@
`"Hmm?@ Ah, you're right.@ Around here, we shouldn't be going so fast that a siren might go off."@
` I slow down.@
` We slowly pass the curve that's like a snake crawling along the ground.\

`"Because if the person you need is by your side, then your happy times can continue forever."@
` That's right.@
` That's because the one who taught me that was you, Akiha.\


`"Got it?@ If you want to be happy forever, then don't desire today to never end----"@

` Grandly flying waves of fireworks.@
` As if all of today's, no, all of this summer's events were being flung into the sky as tempestuous artificial flowers.\

`"The Buddhists have a saying.@ 'All things - are first in the mind - as the foundations of the mind - then come from the mind'|@ In other words, all worlds exist only in your mind."@

br
` The world only exists in the mind?@
br

`"The world, people and everything else, are in your mind."@
`"That means that what I'm seeing and hearing, it's all just the product of my imagination?"\

`"That's right.@ It's a good thing you're smart.@ Added to 'sight,' 'hearing,' 'smell,' 'taste,' 'touch,' the five awarenesses that rule the physical human five senses, and the surface human 'consciousness' are the deeper mentalities of 'Manas' or self awareness, and 'Alaya,' the root of consciousness.@ These eight mental functions form everything in the world.@ Or so they say."@

` Unfamiliar words.@
` I asked for an explanation.@
`"Manas?@ Alaya?"@

`"Yeah, those two are the so-called 'deep mentalities.'@ Manas is the subconscious that influences the surface consciousness.@ That stream of consciousness thing.@ Alaya is|@ yeah, it's the 'source.'"\

`"Source?"@

`"Yeah.@ Everything that's every happened to that human.@ Things seen and heard.@ A gathering, collection of all of those.@ It's the thing that provides impetus, motive to the other seven mental functions.@ To sum it up in one word, it's the 'act.'"@

`"Act|"@

`"Of course, those eight functions don't have a fixed shape.@ They interfere with each other, and each situation shapes the ones after it."@

br
` Right then, something seemed to flicker in my heart.@

` The thing that inverted him was his own|\

`"That's right, Shiki.@ What was inverted in my heart was, most likely, Alaya."@

` Inverted Alaya.@
` Inverted 'acts.'@
` The remaining seven unchanged, only their impetus inverted.@
` And those seven were dragged along.@

` I understood that everything might be a dream.@
` I understand what happened to him, too.@
` But I still don't understand why this present him would appear.@
` Even if he is the real thing, should he still be that murderer?\

`"Damn, you are slow."@
` He ran his hands through his hair.@
` Then he gave a single sigh.@

`"Did you forget about your own eyes?"@

br

` Eyes.@
` The Mystic Eyes of Death Perception.@
` Those eyes that can see fate, especially a fated death.@
` And the power to substantiate that final result.\

`"Eyes that see death won't see anything, right?"@
`"|| If your eyes were truly the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, then yeah, that'd be true."@
` He closed one eye, then looked at me.@

`"| Have you ever thought that?@ Makes sense, doesn't it?"@
` Opening his closed eye, he waved his hands and stood.@
`"Because you are your eyes, and because they've been exposed to death for so long, you've gained the ability to substantiate the very concept of death."@
` Because of that exposure to death, the me that is my eyes can understand death?\

`"In other words, my eyes aren't strictly the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception?"@
`"Yeah.@ Come on, you've seen Akiha's hair, right?"@

br
` Akiha's hair.@
` The hair that can absorb anything.@
` That crimson, far deeper than merely red, crimson hair.@
br

`"|| Yeah.@ I've seen it."@
`"Your eyes are originally eyes like that.@ | That's something you should be saying, though."\

` He slowly turned around.@
` His expression tightened and his eyes shone unhesitantly.@
` Seeing him like that, I was overcome with shock.@

`"| You're talking a lot today."@
` I finally muttered.@
` He gave a twisted smile.@
` With a great exaggerated waving of arms and body, he dropped into a begging pose.\

`"This is just your convenient dream, right?@ Let me do what I want."@
`"That's right."@

` Unconsciously, my own face relaxed.@
` What do I think I'm doing, getting this involved in a dream?@

`"Anyways, if your eyes are 'those eyes,' then|@ You might be able to understand the concept of 'me' as well, is what I'm saying."@

br
` Understanding came to me.\

`"And the me you know is from which time?"@
br
` I could feel my complexly tied up thoughts beginning to unravel.@
` So that's it.@
` I knew my face was smiling.\

`"Probably, the you from eight years ago."@
`"Right.@ That's exactly it.@ And the that 'me' you met before had as a base|"@

br
` I already knew that answer.@
br

`"The concept of 'you' that I was predicting?"@
`"Correct.@ I am Shiki.@ Without doubt, I am Tohno Shiki, Shiki.@ I am the Shiki that was born from Shiki."@
br
` The human called forth from my, Tohno Shiki's, mentality.@
` That's what he is.@ So he's saying.\

`"That's why, Shiki."@
` He closed his eyes.@
` Then put a hand on his hip, and turned his face to the sky.@
` Took a deep breath.@
` And smiled.@
` An amazing smile.@
` The memories of those days began to stir in my mind.\

`"If we assume that this is convenient for you, then|"@
` Slowly his eyes opened.@
` Eyes filled with a strong will.@

`"I haven't inverted, right?"@
`"Yeah.@ If this isn't just a dream, that is."@
`"| What a picky guy you are|"@

` Behind those words, he was laughing amusedly.\

` I wonder what sort of face I'm making, anyway?@
` I sat up.@
` And, like that, leaned against the adjacent trees.@

`"Anyway, since you can't tell which it is, why not go with the way that's more fun?"@
`"||"@
`"That's just the way you are.@ But you know, |"@
` He stopped short there.@
` For a little while, he was wordless.@
` Should he say it, or not?@
` Probably, something like that.\

`"The Shiki that would want to see you, well, that'd be me, right?"@
` A little embarrassedly, he smiled.@
` A bit of a mysterious and amiable smile.@

` That place of hers might seem like it has a mind of its own, but they're both controlled by one will.@

` Each time, my penis stuck within Kohaku's vagina seems to swell without end.\

` Due to that, my reasoning power that was slowly disappearing comes back.@

` I knocked over Hisui and hastily pushed in my hardened penis.\

` My penis that was forcibly put in screams, but it is inserted in without regard for that.@
`"Haaa||!@ Ah, haaa, ha|@ Hhhh!"@

` Shck!@
` Having inserted it about half way, in one breath I pulled it all the way out.@
`"Fwa||!"@
` Making a sweet sound, Hisui raises her chin in a bouncing motion.@
`"See, it's this wet.@ Because this sticky thing poured out from inside Hisui, this part is all slobbery, too.@ All this is Hisui's urine."@
`"|| Ah|| That|| Urine, I didn't, do, such a thi--------"\

`"--------Ha, you really are a bed wetter, Hisui.@ If you're going to be like this, isn't just a finger more than enough?"@
`"--------"@
` Hisui is panting, going 'haa haa.'@

` Hisui just sighs as if nervous.@

`"Now, you wanted to do this, right, Hisui!?"@
` Without restraint, as if trying to get to the end at once, I pushed it in.\

` Still, I don't stop.@

` Hisui's butt and my pelvis keep hitting each other.@
` Every time that happens, Hisui's body convulses, and for one moment, Hisui's inside tightens powerfully.\


`"Huu--------That's, good, Hisui--------"@
`"Ah|| Yes, I'm so happy, Shiki-sama||!"@
` She must not be used to it; Hisui awkwardly starts moving her hips.@ My body matches that, and so we repeat the impacts as if writing an 8.@

` My thing that was being fondled by Hisui until just now twitches, getting ready to expel what has been collecting and collecting.\

`I vigorously push forwards my hips.@ Hisui's bottom puts pressure on the area below my bellybutton.@
`"Yes, yes--!@ Please, love Hisui the way Shiki-sama, desires||!"@

`"|| Ng||"@

`"--------Hhh"@
` At that heat, my waist moved a little.@
` Their tongues, although their temperatures are different, definitely transfer heat to me.\


`"|| Haaa|| Ng||"@
` The leech-like red tongues glide along the shaft.@

` When the glans is touched lightly, it feels a bit itchy instead.@ That irritation makes me even more excited.\


`"Hisui.@ Can't you do it with a little more strength?"@
`"|| Yes, do you mean like this, Shiki-sama?"@
` The tip of the tongue that was only grazing gets more strength put behind it.@
` The feeling of tapping changes to that of slipping.@
` Hisui's tongue, covered in droplets of saliva, wets my hardened penis.@
`"Uhng--------You're lucky, Hisui's part looks more tasty."@
` Kohaku's laughter-like voice.@
` She's still stubbornly only caressing the glans.@
` The tip sparkles from Kohaku's saliva.@
` Pre-ejaculate is already leaking out from the urethra, and Kohaku is carefully lapping it up.\

` The two people, changing places little by little, continued their caressing.@
` Hisui wraps around with the tip of her tongue.@
` Kohaku licks with her entire tongue, as if to embrace it.@
` The penis, slippery from the saliva of the two people, seems to be not of someone used to it like me, but rather the equipment of someone inexperienced.\

` The duo's breaths on my wet body felt good, and the feeling of being licked up and down and side to side was so good that I could barely bear it.@
` However, this doesn't go beyond being an endlessly sweet caress.@
` The feeling that I want to remain indefinitely, if I flip it around, means that it's a feeling that can continue indefinitely.\


`"--------A little stronger, both of you."@

`"Aha|| Shiki-san, became even bigger."@
` With the pouch held in her mouth, relentlessly pressing with her tongue, Kohaku speaks happily.@
`"Yes--------if it becomes this large, then now, by myself,"@
` Pulling her mouth off, Hisui once again starts to lick the shaft with her tongue.@

` The movement of her tongue that used to be only up and down now has a spiral-like twist.\


`"Nnnh|| Shiki-sama, so, wet|| Mmm| Ah."@
` Completely absorbed, Hisui's lips are attached to the glans.@

` If we continue like this, Hisui's insides should become just like those of the one loving her little sister right now.\

` Holding back the ejaculation has turned into pain, and my butt that I was tightening begins to hurt.\

` There, I stabbed my boiling thing.\


`"Nnnh||!"@
` The two people's breaths overlap each other.@
` || Above and below.@
` My bulge, which only touched the surface of their privates, seems to be unable to stand it because it is with two people.@
` The wave of pleasure connect two people.@ The two people by themselves greedily rub my thing that is blocking that connection like a bumper.\


`"Haaa, ng, nnnh||!@ Aha, Shiki-san's thing, seems to be, getting bigger||!"@
` Kohaku comes closer, rubbing my waist.@
` Not losing to that movement,
`"No--------Shiki-sama is, my--------"@
` Hisui rubs from below with her skin as soft as slippery pudding.\


`"Hhhh--------Khhh"@
` That feeling is no worse than when it had been inserted inside.@
` Hisui and Kohaku, their soft skin make a sandwich out of my penis.@
` My penis that is stuck between two privates is pulled close, making bubbles as if being washed by their bodily fluids.\


`"Nnnh|| For some, reason,"
` Especially, Kohaku's tightness was amazing.@
` Even though it's the surface, the feeling that even the bottom will be swallowed.\

` || I retract what I said before.@
` Kohaku is completely different from Hisui.@
` No matter what happens with Hisui, she is different from Kohaku.@
` If Hisui has a body that takes in everything, Kohaku's body is a body that sucks in everything.@
` They might look the same at a quick glance, but their bodies are completely different.@
br
` Hisui looks pathetic and about to break and,
` Kohaku is soft and delicate but still filled with bounce.\


`"Aaah|| Ha, ah|| For some reason, by Hisui, and Shiki-san,"
` It feels like I'm being violated.@
` Kohaku, breathing in ragged gasps, said that.\
`"Yes|| Me too, I, kept, feeling, the same--------"@
` Hisui's scattered voice.@
`"--------"@
` That, something like that.@
` Me too, like them, I was making the same error.\


`"--------Hhhh"@
` Their squeezing becomes deeper and deeper.@
` With just the swelling of my penis that is scraping their surface, their breaths start to slowly become one.@
br
` In that case, this.@
` Is this really what it means to have two people at the same time?\


`"Hisu,i"@
` I move between two privates.@
`"Koha, ku"@
` The two people are, through mine, feeling each other's bodies.@
`"Hisu, i||!"@
` A strangely strong sense of unity.@
` My body that had kept moving was already at the limit, and so when I realized it--------@
`"Koha, ku||!"@
` My breath as well was scattered to the point that I might collapse.\


`--------It's driving me crazy.@
br
` Even though I felt like I was about to throw up, I sped up my breathing, as if trying to go into these two people even stronger.\


`"Hhhh--------it's coming, both of you||!"@
` I free myself from my own restraints.@
br
`"--------Yes, please come, Shiki--------!"@
` The voice of these two in response to my voice.@
`"--------!!!!!!!!"@
` The white color that erupts from my genitals.@
` That scattered all over their bodies with the fierceness of a waterfall, and that thing, shaking from the shock of the ejaculation, sent a final wave through the two.\

` 1. Meet the black cat in various places.@
` 2．Experience many different days.@
` 3．Sometimes go out far away.@
` 4．Sometimes wander the streets alone.@
` These four steps are necessary."\

` Welcome to the English patch of Kagetsu Tohya.@
br
` Before we give the word to TYPE-MOON, a few things regarding this translation.\

` First and most importantly, do not use this patch with illegal copies of Kagetsu Tohya, and do not distribute it alongside any illegal copies of the game or parts thereof.@
br
` This is a fan translation, made by fans for fans.@ Please do not charge money for it.@
br
` Finally, this software is distributed 'as is' and without any guarantees, technically or content-wise, whatsoever.\

` It is highly recommended to read the entirety of Tsukihime before playing this, since it does not make a lot of sense otherwise.@ Mirror Moon's excellent translation is what inspired us to make this, after all.\

` Like Tsukihime, Kagetsu Tohya contains both very violent and explicit sexual content, and is definitely not suitable for minors.@
` This English patch adds the option of skipping all the explicit erotic content in the game. This option is disabled by default.@ If you do not wish to view this content, it is recommended that you enable this function right now.\

` Do you agree to these terms?
br
selgosub	`1. Yes, and I want to view all content.`,*eroenable,
		`2. Yes, and I want to skip erotic content.`,*erodisable,
		`3. No, I don't agree.`,*termsnotaccepted

` You can change this setting at any time in the 'Game settings' menu.@
br
` That's it from us, we hope you enjoy Kagetsu Tohya!\

` Thank you for purchasing Kagetsu Tohya.@
br
` Kagetsu Tohya is a game which you play many times, increasing the number of choices, in order to get to the end.\

` Don't just try to "win," but try experimenting with the choices.@
` Depending on your progress in the game, you will unlock special graphics or side stories.@
br
` This game is a bit more complicated than Tsukihime, so those of you who lack confidence, please use the help feature in the top right corner.\

` When at the end of the day
`　　　ｒｅｐｅａｔ　ａｇａｉｎ・・・
` is shown, the game state is automatically saved.@
` Just start a new game and keep playing.\

` There is no need to use the save or load functions, but please use them if you have to quit in the middle of playing.\
